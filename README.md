# ML-projects
Machine learning projects that were done as part of the Y-data course.   
Done together with *Neta Kohn*.    
Course instructors: *Lior Sidi*, *Noa Lubin*, *Segev Arbiv*, *Guy Shtar* and *Gleb Ivashkevich*

Machine learning algorithm implementations:
* [K-Nearest Neighbours implementation](k-Nearest-Neighbours-implementation.ipynb)
* [Gradient descent implemtation](Gradient-Descent-implementation.ipynb)
* [SVM (PEGASOS) implementation](svm_implementation.ipynb)
* [Naive Bayes implementation](Naive-Bayes-implementation.ipynb)

Additional tasks:
* [Time series classification](Time_series_classification.ipynb)
* [Anomaly detection](Anomaly_detection_in_time_series.ipynb)
